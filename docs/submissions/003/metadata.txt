description: I am an avid lifelong journaler and writer, a process I use to connect with parts of myself and the world, in efforts to access deeper truths. This is by far the most raw poem I have ever written. I wrote this in a chapter of deep survival as I began to connect with layer after layer of truth of my childhood and inner wiring. It is about becoming a first time mother in the deep pandemic without family support and awakening to profound intergenerational trauma.
