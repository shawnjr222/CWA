description: "I am an avid lifelong journaler and writer, a process I use to connect with parts of myself and the world, in efforts to access deeper truths. This is by far the most raw poem I have ever written. I wrote this in a chapter of deep survival as I began to connect with layer after layer of truth of my childhood and inner wiring. It is about becoming a first time mother in the deep pandemic without family support and awakening to profound intergenerational trauma."

writing: LOST  Submerged in oceans of black grief Struggle Anguish  Lost, ancient wounds puncturing the heart Throbbing, aching from lifetimes of accumulated pressure Blood flooding over hands Uncontainable  Walls of red blood flooded my Brain. Body. Life Flooding Flooding The unrecognizable self  Dying, I turned to  My father Dying, I turned to My mother Head bowed Raw hands outstretched Reaching Desperate  In full death, I grasped With battered knuckles and fingertips In fragmented need, I searched Mind overtaken with darkness before me In overwhelming pain, I sought The illusion of parents from before Only to touch Nothing   My father My mother Never came My father My mother Never there Vacant, numb ghosts  Electric shock riddled my body All-subsuming, the blood rose Empty hands Inviting  The dawn of awakening
